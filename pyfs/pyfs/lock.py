# This exists because OS shared and exclusive locks
# are not always consistent, especially on shared filesystems.
# This setup works by first having the thread create a unique file lock
# under the same path as the target path.  This file is then hardlinked
# to a deteministic lock path.  The linking operation should be atomic
# in which case only a single process will succeed in linking.
#
# Special care is also taken to clean up any and all files created during
# this process, even if the process is interrupted or aborted.
# Note: locks can be still be left if computers are shut down unexpectedly
#       or there are network problems
